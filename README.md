Frogger
========

Example of Frogger game implementation using [MOAI SDK](http://getmoai.com) and [Shilke2D](https://github.com/Shrike78/Shilke2D) lua framework.

The example is based on [Roger Engelbert article](http://www.rengelbert.com/tutorial.php?id=162). Assets are taken from the project sample provided with the article 
and the code is a translation of the [Starling sample](http://www.rengelbert.com/tutorial.php?id=163).

[Shilke2D](https://github.com/Shrike78/Shilke2D) lib must be placed in the main directory of the project in order to execute it.
